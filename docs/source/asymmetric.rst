Asymmetric Cryptography
=======================

Asymmetric cryptography (public-key cryptography) uses a key pair: a public key for encryption or verification, and a private key for decryption or signing. Algorithms like RSA provide encryption and digital signatures, while Diffieâ€“Hellman (DH) enables secure key exchange.
