Secure Hash Algorithms
======================

SHA algorithms (e.g., SHA-1, SHA-256) produce a fixed-size digest from arbitrary input data. They are designed to be collision-resistant, meaning it is computationally infeasible to find two inputs with the same hash. SHA is used for integrity verification, digital signatures, and building cryptographic protocols.
