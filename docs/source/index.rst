========================
pycrypt
========================

A pure Python implementation of cryptographic primitives, written in a clean,
Pythonic, and type-safe way.


.. note::
    **Disclaimer:** `pycrypt` is an **educational cryptography library**.
    It is **not safe for production use**. Use only to **learninge** how
    cryptographic algorithms work under the hood. For production, use a vetted library such as
    `cryptography <https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/>`_.

Overview
========

`pycrypt` implements major cryptographic primitives **from scratch** in pure Python
with minimal dependencies. It is designed for learners and developers interested
in the inner workings of cryptography.

Use cases include:

- Learning how encryption, hashing, and key exchange algorithms work.
- Exploring low-level arithmetic operations.
- Teaching cryptography fundamentals to intermediate Python developers.

Installation
============

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pycrypt-lib


Usage Examples
==============

Diffie–Hellman (DH) Key Exchange
--------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    from pycrypt.asymmetric import DH

    params = DH.generate_parameters(2048)

    alice_priv = params.generate_private_key()
    bob_priv = params.generate_private_key()

    alice_shared = alice_priv.exchange(bob_priv.public_key())
    bob_shared = bob_priv.exchange(alice_priv.public_key())

    assert alice_shared == bob_shared
    print(f"Shared secret: {alice_shared.hex()}")


RSA Encryption and Signing
--------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    from pycrypt.asymmetric import RSAKey

    key = RSAKey.generate(2048)
    message = b"Hello RSA!"

    cipher = key.oaep_encrypt(message)
    plain = key.oaep_decrypt(cipher)

    signature = key.pss_sign(message)
    assert key.pss_verify(message, signature)


AES Encryption (GCM Mode)
-------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    from secrets import token_bytes
    from pycrypt.symmetric import AES_GCM

    key = token_bytes(16)
    nonce = token_bytes(12)

    aes = AES_GCM(key)
    ciphertext, tag = aes.encrypt(b"Top Secret", nonce=nonce)
    plaintext = aes.decrypt(ciphertext, nonce=nonce, tag=tag)

    print(plaintext.decode())


SHA-256 Hashing
---------------

.. code-block:: python

    from pycrypt.hash import SHA256

    sha = SHA256()
    sha.update(b"hello world")
    print(sha.hexdigest())


Design Philosophy
=================

- **Pure Python** - minimal external dependencies
- **Readable and modular** - core logic and implementation are seperated for clarity
- **Type-safe** - uses `typing` and `ruff` for static checks
- **Educational focus** - clarity > performance
- **Standards-aligned** - based on official cryptographic specs
