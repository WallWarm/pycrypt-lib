Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
===========================
Diffieâ€“Hellman is a key exchange protocol that allows two parties to securely derive a shared secret over an insecure channel. The security relies on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms in a finite group. DH is commonly used to establish symmetric session keys in protocols like TLS.
